> _Vladimir is an excellent physic lecturer because he awaked student’s imagination and curiosity. When he talked about universe – gravity – relativity – the basic rules of life – Wolfram language, I wished our secondary’s teachers showed and asked me the things like he did– may be some of kids at my generation, in a disadvantaged area could dream and go far further. It was sometimes ashamed to admit that – people nowadays care too much on social science and forget Natural Science though natural science is exactly the beginning of existence. If you looking for a simple computer language to compute, write and play music by coding, make web apps to learn new language, draw charts to make numbers more visual, interactive, easy and fun, then Wolfram could be one of best options. Different from the other computer languages, Wolfram language is open for everyone – it doesn't matter how old you are or how much knowledge you have, which background you are profesional at, you still can learn and work well with it. Everything you have to do is read – think logically – practice, practice and practice. So the question is How long time you need to accquire a new computer language like Wolfram? Of couse - there is no correct answers. It’s based on your feeling experiences with that – if you see the magic and must whisper aloud “Wow” – time doesn't matter. Being more open and passionate is a key. If you travelling somewhere and meet 2 guys and 1 tall –beautiful lady, one of them is curly hair with sweet voice who is ready to jump from the chair along with 2 full bottles of water 5-10 times just to prove that objects fall down to the ground at the same time, then just say “hi” and give him a hug. Maybe he can entertain you with some magic shows. Good luck!_ — Giang, one of the students
