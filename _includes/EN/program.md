## Program

The subjects taught at the Summer school will include:

1. Wolfram Language â€” an all-in-one toolbox for quick prototyping, doing science and doing everything else.
2. Functional programming concept and practice.
3. Introduction to the New Kind of Science by Stephen Wolfram.
4. Basic  introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
5. Some basic topics from modern physics, technology and neuroscience.

In addition, during the school every student will finish his own personal project, supervised by one of our instructors. The projects may have any topic and will be individually chosen for each student. On the last few days there will be a project showcase and a conference-style public defense where studets will tell about their results with the projects.
