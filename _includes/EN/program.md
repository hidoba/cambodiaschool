## Program

The subjects taught at the Summer school will include:

1. Wolfram Language — an all-in-one toolbox for quick prototyping, doing science and doing everything else.
2. Functional programming concept and practice.
3. Introduction to the New Kind of Science by Stephen Wolfram.
4. Basic  introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
5. Some basic topics from modern physics, technology and neuroscience.

In addition, during the school every student will finish his own personal project, supervised by one of our instructors. The projects may have any topic and will be individually chosen for each student. On the last few days there will be a project showcase and a conference-style public defense where studets will tell about their results with the projects.

The course will be going on from Monday to Friday, September 20 to October 20, 2016. There will be 2 sessions of lectures (2 groups of students), in the morning and evening. Every student can choose morning or evening group depending on which time is more convenient to him. The morning lectures go from 8:00 AM to approximately 12:00 PM, while some students are invited to stay longer to work on their projects with our supervisors. The evening classes will be from 5:00PM to 8:30PM. The schedule of most of the days will be like that:

8:00AM – 10:00AM — lecture

10:30AM – 12:00AM – discussion groups or lecture

1:30PM – 5:00PM – work on the personal projects with supervisors (optional, but recommended)

5:00PM – 8:30PM — second session for students who can't attend the first session
